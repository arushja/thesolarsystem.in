        <p>Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
        <p>Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity – the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.</p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(151, 230, 241);">The Planets Of The Solar System-</h2>

        <br>
        
        <h2 style="color: white;">Mercury-</h2> 

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Mercury_in_true_color.jpg" alt="" height="400" width="400">
        
        <br>
        
        <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes. Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is more difficult to observe than Venus. From Earth, the planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.</p>

        <h2 style="color: White;">Venus-</h2>

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Venus_from_Mariner_10.jpg" height="400" lenght="400">
 
        <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth's closest planetary neighbor. It's one of the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it's often called Earth's twin because it's similar in size and density. These are not identical twins, however there are radical differences between the two worlds. </p>
        <p>Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it's perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It's the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Surface temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) hot enough to melt lead. The surface is a rusty color and it's peppered with intensely crunched mountains and thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists think It's possible some volcanoes are still active.</p>

        <h2 style="color: White;">Earth-</h2>

        <p>Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that's inhabited by living things.</p>
        <p>While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.</p>
        <p>The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”</p>
        
        <br>

        <h2 style="color: White;">Mars-</h2>

        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/ca_chinamarsmission_051421istock_0.jpg?w=2000&ssl=1" height="400" width="600">

        <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past.</p>

        <p>Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.</p>

        <br>

        <h2 style="color: white;">Jupiter-</h2>

        <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/10/27/17/17/jupiter-1009305_960_720.jpg" height="400" width="500">

        <p>Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe.</p>
        <p>Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.</p>
        <p>Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.</p>

        <br>

        <h2 style="color: white;">Saturn-</h2>

        <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/02/13/01/34/astronomy-2061583_960_720.jpg" height="400" width="600">

        <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system.</p>
        <p>Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have rings made of chunks of ice and rock but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's.</p>
        <p>Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.</p>

        <br>

        <h2 style="color: white;">Uranus-</h2>

        <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2012/01/09/10/56/uranus-11625_960_720.jpg" height="400" width="400">

       <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest diameter in our solar system. It was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star.</p>
       <p>It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode. Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III. Instead, the scientific community accepted Bode's suggestion to name it Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Bode.</p>
       
       <br>

       <h2 style="color: white;">Neptune-</h2>

       <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2012/11/28/09/17/neptune-67537_960_720.jpg" height="400" width="400">

       <p>Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system.</p>
       <p>More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye and the first predicted by mathematics before its discovery. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.</p>
